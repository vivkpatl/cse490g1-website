# Deep Learning (CSE 490G1) Final Project: American Sign Langugage Classification Using Neural Networks
**Group Members: Vivek Patel, Hayoung Jung**

## Abstract
To identify and classify American Sign Language (i.e. ASL) images into correct English alphabet characters, we employed convolutional neural networks in order to effectively execute the task quickly and accurately. The model was trained and tested on 87,000 ASL image dataset from Kaggle. We investigated and experimented with various model network architectures, image data augmentations, hyperparamters, and transfer learning with AlexNet in order to obtain the performance. Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 100% on our 28-image test suite of ASL characters while obtaining 98.7126% validation accuracy. Our results suggest that deep learning models can accurately classify ASL images, making them incredible tools for those who are beginning to learn American Sign Language. Our result findings also suggest that training simple models from scratch on a dataset can have a much better performance compared to trying to finetune a powerful, complicated network to a different task.  




## Problem Statement
American Sign Language (also known as ASL) is a visual language often used for communication by those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Live ASL interpreters are a facet of many public and private events as a means of increasing accessibility, but for individuals who are new to learning ASL, the interpreters can move too fast. Realtime ASL translation into a familiar language can be a good stepping stone for people in those circumstances, and a piece of that is characterizing individual ASL characters. We believe that neural networks can be incredibly useful tools for classifying each ASL character into english alphabet character accurately and quickly. In this project, we build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify a given image of an ASL sign into the correct English alphabet characters.
